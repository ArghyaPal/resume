## Research Interest

Modern deep neural network models require large amounts of task-specific curated training data to perform well. Creating such annotated training data by hand is often too slow, inflexible and expensive. Unfortunately, heuristic methods, such as data augmentation, are limited in scope, and do not provide richness in the variety of training data. 

My current research aims to raise the level of abstraction at which generative adversarial methods are used to generate data, by learning joint and conditional distributions that allow integration of robust annotation into the generative model. In particular, we propose programmable image generation and video generation, where the content and annotation of generated images and videos can be programmed by a user or learnt automatically from past examples. Generating curated data in this manner will provide new impetus to scale deep network models to newer domains quickly and effectively.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ArghyaPal/resume/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
